Here we use tools such as the pandas and fxcmpy python packages to analyze Bitcoin's relation to the U.S dollar.
The library fxcmpy accesses the RESTful API of the FOREX trading platform.
An example of one of the indicators used in my algorithmic trading strategy are Bollinger Bands.
Here is a figure comparing the Bollinger Bands with standard deviation 1 and 2 to the asking closing price of Bitcoin.
The regression line of this time period is also graphed.
More information of the algorithmic trading strategy may be provided upon request.
